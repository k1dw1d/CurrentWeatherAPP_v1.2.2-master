APP Name: WeatherAPP

Group Members:  Cristian Ceruta

We have used in this app:
 - API Call by coordinates from https://openweathermap.org/current                  **//Function java Class
 - GPS Location of the device                                                       **//GPS java Class
 - Room Database (for inputing a list of city_names and country_ID)                 **//Database Package Folder
 - RecyclerView (for laying out the list of locations the user will insert)         **//Locations Package Folder
 
 The APP will not call the weather by inserting the city_name and country_ID in the **//inputLocation Activity
 
 The APP wil call the weather only by the device coordinates.
